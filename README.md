## Description

In The Loop is a web based full-stack application designed to teach users about loops and how to effectively utilize them.  Many other kinds of online "coding workbooks" exist, but very few focus on loops directly.  We thought this problem could be solved, and so we created In The Loop!  In creating this application, we learned to effectively link MongoDB databased using graphql and apollo into one application, with a frontend powered by react.



## Planning
We started out by planning out our database structure and styling ahead of time.  
We started with a wireframe of our pages, our homepage and javascript page.  Originally we had a separate dashboard page, but we removed it until we finish our next language's tutorial.
Original idea:

We also planned the way our databases would interact and created a diagram showing the flow of data.

## Technical Requirements

All technical requirements were accomplished for this project. The technical requirements are as follows: 

- Use technologies outside of what we were taught in class (Sweet Alerts, )
- Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
-Include user authentication
- Host servers
- Use databses to store persistent data
- Be responsive to different screen sizes
- Have a polished UI
- Protect sensitive API key information on the server.
- Include authentication (JWT)
- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.)
- Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application)
- Be deployed (We used Heroku)

## Future Development

There are multiple opportunities for future development with this site:
- Creating a way to store and keep finished questions
- CSS and HTML pages
- Moving the questions to a database
- Recreating the dashboard
- Tracking user progress
- Designated quiz page for future quizzes
